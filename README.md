# Radius Agent


## Architecture and Patterns

- Multi-layered architecture (Data, Service, Domain, Presentation)
    
- SOLID principles

- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern

- Reactive and functional programming

## Tools

- SwiftUI framework for building user interfaces.

- Combine framework for reactive programming and data flow management.

- URLSession for network requests.

- swift-collections package, integrated via Swift Package Manager (SPM).

- Swift concurrency with async/await for handling asynchronous operations.


## TODO

All modules are inherently unit-testable. If more time is allocated, writing unit tests using XCTest can be considered to ensure code quality and stability.
